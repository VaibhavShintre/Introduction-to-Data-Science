Data Dictionary: Student.txt, this file is the data dictionary.

Report 5b contributions: For the report, what generally happened is that Austin selected the data and did the dataset cleaning regarding fixing the delimiter issue about the csv files being separated by semicolon instead of a comma. Amrish wrote the background about the data and did data wrangling about changing the column names. Vaibhav wrote the data merging section. Lavan did the exploratory data analysis part and helped analyze the inconsistencies in the data. Also we worked on this project in meetings only where all 4 people were present and working on the document and code together.
